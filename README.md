# Monte-Carlo-Integration
A brief script showcasing the Monte Carlo method to integrate functions

In this case, the very simple sin(x) is integrated between the limits 0 and pi - accurate to 2 decimal places, the result is (correctly) found to be 2.00.

The Monte Carlo simulation uses randomness to quickly and (somewhat) accurately find the area of functions
